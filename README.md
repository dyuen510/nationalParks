# nationalParks

Simple project that I created using html, css, javascript and json data provided from 'https://prm-interview.s3.amazonaws.com/parks.json'

To be able to get across the cors and retrieve data from the json file I used a proxy URL from https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to easily retrieve the data with ajax and then appending all data. 

This project displays National Parks in the United States. Each national park from the json file is separated into it's own section with borders, padding and margins. Each one displays the park's name, location, area in acres and km2, visits, some description and an image.
